= Facebooker

Facebooker is a Ruby wrapper over the Facebook[http://facebook.com] {REST API}[http://developer.facebook.com].  Its goals are:

* Idiomatic Ruby
* No dependencies outside of the Ruby standard library
* Concrete classes and methods modeling the Facebook data, so it's easy for a Rubyist to understand what's available
* Well tested

= Installing

The best way is:

  gem install facebooker

If, for some reason, you can't/won't use RubyGems, you can do:

  (sudo) ruby setup.rb



== Work in Progress

I'm not saying it meets its goals fully yet.  Please help.  I'm especially interested in feedback and criticism re: Ruby style and design and testing.  RCov has the library (at the time of this writing) at 100% coverage.  I take that with a grain of salt, but it's a good start.

== Contribute

Please visit the {RubyForge project page}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/facebooker] to get the latest source via svn, write some tests, add/fix features, and submit a patch via the tracker.  If you submit a good patch, it's likely that I'll add you to the project for commit access if you want to be added.
